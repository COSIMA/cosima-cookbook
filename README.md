# cosima-cookbook package

This repository hosts the `cosima_cookbook` which is a [Python package](https://anaconda.org/coecms/cosima-cookbook) for managing a database of ocean model output and loading the output via xarray.

⚠️ `cosima_cookbook` Python package is deprecated and no longer being developed! ⚠️

Use the [ACCESS-NRI Intake catalog](https://cosima-recipes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Tutorials/ACCESS-NRI_Intake_Catalog.html) instead.

## What now? Where should I go?

We refer users to [COSIMA Cookbook repository](https://github.com/COSIMA/cosima-recipes) where they will find tutorials and 'recipes' (that is, examples) of various analyses that one can do using ocean-sea ice model output.
