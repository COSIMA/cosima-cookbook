COSIMA-Cookbook is a solution for efficient calculation diagnostics of
output of high resolution an ocean and ice model. It is targeted
at the COSIMA community where models (e.g. MOM5) are run on NCI
resources such as raijin.

The problem of dealing with increasing large output from atmosphere,
climate, and ocean models is being addressed by several groups.  
Active development is currently underway as part of
the PangeoData_ initiative.  COSIMA-Cookbok logically sits on top
of that project.
