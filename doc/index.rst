COSIMA Cookbook
===============

Ocean and ice models are evaluated and compared by using diagnostics.
This cookbook is a collection of such diagnostics that will useful to the
ocean and sea ice modelling done by the
`COSIMA <http://cosima.org.au>`_ community.

The focus is the
`MOM5 ocean model <http://www.mom-ocean.org/web>`_.

The cookbook is under active development on
Github: `COSIMA-Cookbook <https://github.com/OceansAus/cosima-cookbook>`_

It provides both examples of diagnostics to adapt to your own use and summaries
of diagnostics for models run by members of the community.
