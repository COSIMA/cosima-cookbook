This repository is a gallery of self contained analysis examples.

Setting up a development environment
====================================

Jupyter notebooks:

[NCI Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)](http://nci.org.au/services/vdi/)

These notebooks are designed to run on tenjin.nci.org.au which includes the VDI.  

This cookbook assumes a Python computational environment and access to 
the NCI infrastructure.
