ACCESS-OM2-01
=============

ACCESS-OM2-01 is a newer 1/10° ocean-sea ice model. It uses MOM5.1 with 0.25° lateral resolution at the Equator, tripolar in the north and Mercator projection down to 65°S, with 75 vertical levels. The sea ice is CICE5.1, coupled with the OASIS3-MCT coupler. The model can be forced using either CORE or JRA forcing sets.
