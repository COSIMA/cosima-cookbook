   :header: "Name", "Description"

   "GFDL50", "Original simulation with 50 vertical levels. Ran from Levitus for about 60 years, but data output only saved from about year 40."
   "KDS75", "Branched from GFDL50 at year 45 (re-zeroed), but with Kial Stewart's 75 level scheme. Has now run for 103 years. Years 90-100 have 5-daily output."
   "KDS75_wind", | Short (5-year) Antarctic wind perturbation case, branched from KDS75 at year 40."
   "KDS75_PI", Paul Spence's Poleward Intensification wind experiment. Branched from KDS75 at year 70, will run until year 100 with 5-daily output for the last decade"
   "KDS75_UP", Paul Spence's Increased winds case. Branched from KDS75 at year 70, will run until year 100 with 5-daily output for the last decade. (In Progress)"
