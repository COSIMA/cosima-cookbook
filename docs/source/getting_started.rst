Getting Started
===============

Some users may find it sufficient to browse through the sample diagnostics
and model configurations provided.  In order to reproduce these results
on your own, you will need a Python 3 development environment.

The cookbook itself includes a Python 3 package that contains the
diagnostics themselves and some utility functions.  The Jupyter IPython
notebooks that can be downloaded from the cookbook need this package
(called cosima_cookbook) to be installed.

Choosing your platform
======================

COSIMA ocean and ice models are typically run on `NCI <nci.org.au>`_ computing
platform.  The output data is very large and it is assumed that this
data resides on a NCI storage system.

The cookbook may be used on several different platforms:

#. `Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) <http://nci.org.au/services/vdi/>`_
#. `Raijin raijin.nci.org.au <http://nci.org.au/systems-services/peak-system/raijin/>`_ using qsub
#. `Tenjin tenjin.nci.org.au <http://nci.org.au/systems-services/cloud-computing/tenjin/>`_ using virtual machines and NFS mounted directories
#. Local workstation or laptop with data accessible over sshfs or OPeNDAP

For this documentation, we will assume you are running your analysis using
the VDI.  Use the
`VDI User Guide <https://opus.nci.org.au/display/Help/VDI+User+Guide>`_
to get connect to the VDI.

Once connected, open a terminal (Applications -> System Tools -> Terminal).

If your connection to the VDI is too slow, can can also also ssh directly to a VDI
node and work over ssh tunnels. Ask James Munroe for more information.

1. Clone the cosima-cookbook repository::

    git clone https://github.com/OceansAus/cosima-cookbook.git
    cd cosima-cookbook

[Alternative: set up SSH keys for github:: 
    
    git clone git@github.com:OceansAus/cosima-cookbook.git
    
]

2. The cookbook is built using Python so we need a Python development environment
with the following packages installed:

 jupyter matplotlib pandas numpy dask distributed xarray netcdf4
 bokeh seaborn datashader python-graphviz basemap cartopy

There is a miniconda environment with all of these packages accessible from the VDI and raijin::

    module use /g/data3/hh5/public/modules
    module load conda/analysis3

[Alternative: install your own conda environment. In that case, you may omit the --user flag below.]

3. Install the cosima-cookbook package. Within the cosima-cookbook directory, run::

    pip install --user -e .

This installs the cosima-cookbook so that it is available in your
current Python environment.  The '-e' switch means editable; changes to
the cosima_cookbook project can be made without having to reinstall.
(Eventually, the cosima_cookbook package will be made available through
PyPi and as a conda package but this is still in development).

4. Finally, run the Jupyter notebook from the cookbook directory::

    jupyter notebook

.. You can also connect to this Jupyter notebook using an SSH tunnel. See `scripts/jupyter_vdi.py`_.
